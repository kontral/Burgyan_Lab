Bioinformatic scripts used by the Burgyan J. Lab

We have decided to upload scripts that we use in our research for better reproducibility and transparency.

Credit also goes out to Simon Moxon (The Genome Analyses Centre, Norwich, UK) who is not a member of the Burgyan Lab but he is a cooperateing member. Some scirpts in this repo was writen by him and some were based on his scripts.
